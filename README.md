# RPFlagger

This AddOn allows for some 'RP flagging', meaning to display custom other players have set for themselves. There are several conditions to be met:

 * The viewer - not the bearer of the flag - has to have this addon installed
 * Both persons must share at least one guild
 * The bearer of the flag has to set it using a pattern like '##RP: text ##' in his guild notice, like '##RP: God amongst mortals ##'
